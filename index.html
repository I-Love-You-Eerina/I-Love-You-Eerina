  Clever girl :) the fact that you actually checked out the source code makes me love you all the more lmao. Here's the fountain dream:
    
    A fountain that quenched every thirst, healed the sick, and radiated love. A beautiful spirit that cared for the world with all of its imperfections. An impossible combination of the loving and understanding — caring in spite of seeing that which many would consider irreprehensible, comprehending of the complexity that is life, and focused on healing and recuperation — in effect quenching the thirst of a need for satisfaction and meaning — rather than taking a surface level view/judgment of all that which presents itself to its shores. All accepting of those that come to the fountain, the spirit seeks only to nourish, sustain, and heal those that seek its help rather than to affect an imposition of its own will upon the sick in order to brutalize them into submission to an alternative ideal. So brilliant as to blind the unprepared, an incomparable and incomprehensible light underlies the fountain, by which the blossoming of thousands of lotus flowers are made true. A glorification to be sure, and yet somehow still insufficient. Next to fountains of honey and wine, the spirit dwelled — ever loving, ever satisfying, ever understanding — a true manifestation of all that which one ought to strive to be in this realm of reality. With radiant eyes, a shining smile, and a brilliant laugh, she oversaw the recuperation of trillions across universes. A palace of marble with three primary sections and minarets with a floor of 3/4-trimmed grass and a sky of unfathomable colors draped the background, with scores of trumpets serving as background music to the majesty of this other world. A circumscribing forest of impenetrable density and impossibly tall trees made for a border, with vines and roots and trunks and flowers and fruits of gargantuan size intertwining to form a wall of vegetation, save for a cobblestone tunnel through the plants that served as the entrance to the majestic plane from an elevated pool encircled by golden/silver/platinum/copper twine containing swirling pale blue and light red (nearly pinkish) souls.

Happy Birthday Eerina :)

<br><br>

Words can't describe what you mean to me, but I’ll be damned if I don’t do my best to capture it anyways. I’ve known you for less than 10 weeks in person, and it’ll only have been a month of being together this coming Monday – and yet, I’ve already fallen for you faster and more intensely than I could have ever imagined. Your smile, your intelligence, your humor, your laugh, your love, your beauty, everything about you drives me goddamn crazy. I’m the luckiest man in the universe when I’m with you, and when I’m not at your side, you’re all that I can think about. I loved taking you out to hike at Rancho and I love taking you out to dinner :) though we should still hit up Bergin again sometime in order to review more Scheme/C++ lmao. I love watching you play the Last of Us 2, I love watching movies with you (though don’t ask me about what happened in them lol), and I love to spend time just BSing and making jokes with you :)

<br><br>

You bring me so much goddamn joy it’s incredible, and I admire the hell out of your intellect. I know you insist that your mind melts around me, and I’m absolutely the same way around you lol, but your determination to do well at school and superior cognition were the first traits that I admired about you (in conjunction with just how amazing you looked on our first zoom call of course lmao). Once we met up in person, I realized you also had a hell of a sense of humor, and that’s when I realized I’d have to keep a tight leash on myself to stay professional around you (despite how obvious I ended up being lol). Nevertheless, the fact that you have mutual feelings for me still brings me so much joy and makes me intensely thankful. I will never forget the moment in the rose garden when you looked up at me after reading the fountain spirit dream I had and asked if that’s how I really saw you – the truth is, it absolutely pales in comparison to the majesty in which I truly held you at the time. And yet, somehow, my impression of (and appreciation for) you only increases with each passing day :)

<br><br>

I know that it’s barely been a month that we’ve been together, and that as such I ought to temper my emotions, but holy shit my heart won’t stop singing that you’re the only woman I ever want to spend the rest of my life with – I fucking love you to death Eerina, you’re absolutely incredible and deserve only the best that this world has to offer. I love you :)

<br><br>

I hope that you have a wonderful Thanksgiving break back in Texas, and I can’t wait to see you as soon as you’re back :) 

<br><br>

P.S. I’m drafting this out right next to you in Tuesday’s office hours at Heafey the week before break, and you look goddamn incredible right now :) it’s taking all of my self control not to just kiss you right here and right now lmao

<br><br>

I love you to pieces Eerina, and I'll always be there for you :)

<br><br>

Sincerely,

<br><br>
